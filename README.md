### Multiclipboard

Makes the computer clipboard more flexible, you can save data to a JSON file from your clipboard here with a key to save it and load the data back to your clipboard.

Basically, this makes your clipboard more flexible

### To install modules
To install dependencies, basically only clipboard.py, but i'm trying to look fancy
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

### Commands
'''
py mcb.py load
/to load the data from your clipboard and save it with a key
'''
'''
py mcb.py load
/to retrieve the saved data, back to your clipboard, with the key first used
'''
'''
py mcb.py list
/list all the saved data in the clipboard
'''
### Note
You can't yet delete from the json file,
which im going to do later, i did this in one night and i need sleep

Although
you can overwrite already saved data by saving new data with the same key
